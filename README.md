# networking-presentation

- Install [go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Install go present - `go get https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present`
- Run `present` from the command line. This might not work if `$GOPATH/bin` is not in your `PATH`. In that you can run it by `$GOPATH/bin/present` on Linux (something similar for Windows)
